# Call-Notifer

An app that will notifer the users about calls of other users

## issues

- I am not sure how to imeplement the [call screening service](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/CallScreeningService) for android. Specifically the [Becoming the CallScreeningService](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/CallScreeningService#becoming-the-callscreeningservice) section.
- I dont have an iphone to test the app on it.

The only part that's left to implement is the logging of the calls and notification feature.
